# git-hook-exts
This make using hooks to automate your works

## Motivation
Have you been working with GIT and Jira? I think you have. 

There are a lot of works you must done after pushed your code: Change ticket status, Make a comment to your PR, MR or the ticket, etc.

That's why I think about a collection of git hook extentions.
### What is the difference ?
Someone can tell me: "Why don't you use git hook and jira web hooks ..."
1. Sometimes your git and jira can not connect to each other (my case)
2. Actively automate your works and improve your productivity.

## Plan
1. Configurable (*)
2. Automate Jira 
   1. Ticket comments
